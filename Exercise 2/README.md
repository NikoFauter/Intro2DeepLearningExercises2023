# Exercise 2


Before starting this exercise, make sure you have completed the setup instructions from exercise one, as this exercise will need the environment.  
After you set everything up, your task consists of working through the notebooks in the exercise folder in jupyter and creating solutions for the tasks in the notebooks. The order in which you should work through the notebooks is as follows:

1. [exercise2_regression_example.ipynb](./exercise2_regression_example.ipynb): Does not contain any tasks, but gives you some example code for performing linear regression in python, along with visualizations. Use this to play around with the provided code and familiarize yourself with the concepts.  
2. [exercise2_regression_houses.ipynb](./exercise2_regression_houses.ipynb): Similar to the previous notebook, but uses a different dataset and it's now your task to perform the regression.  
3. [exercise2_classification_binary.ipynb](./exercise2_classification_binary.ipynb): Extends the method of linear regression to perform a simple classification task. Note: Some tasks are to be done after the next notebook!  
4. [exercise2_classification_iris.ipynb](./exercise2_classification_iris.ipynb): Similar to the previous notebook, but using a different dataset and multiple classes.  
5. [exercise2_classification_binary.ipynb](./exercise2_classification_binary.ipynb): After the iris classification notebook, come back to this binary classification notebook for the final part of the tasks.  

The notebooks sometimes contain tasks prefixed with "Bonus:". In that case, that task is optional. All other tasks are mandatory. But note that it is not required that the submitted notebooks are fully correct and/or functional, but it must be clearly visible that the tasks were attempted, and if unsuccessful, please write a few sentences about the things you struggled with. After the submission deadline, you will receive reference solutions for the mandatory tasks.
