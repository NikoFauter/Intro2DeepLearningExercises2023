# Exercise 3


This is the assignment for the second exercise. The order in which you should work through the notebooks is as follows:

1. [exercise3_regression_gradient.ipynb](./exercise3_regression_gradient.ipynb): Implement Linear Regression with backpropagation  
2. [exercise3_regression_gradient_pytorch.ipynb](./exercise3_regression_gradient_pytorch.ipynb): Same as the first notebook, but using PyTorch instead of Numpy.
3. [exercise3_regression_gradient_pytorch_optim.ipynb](./exercise3_regression_gradient_pytorch_optim.ipynb): Further simplification by using PyTorch `nn.optim` classes instead of manual calculations.

Once you are done with the exercise, upload your solutions contained in a solutions folder to your personal git fork.
